      <div class="info">This webpage displays every educational project I have done throughout my time pursuing The Odin Project. These taught me HTML, CSS, and JS. Each project has a brief description and overview of what I learned. As I continue with The Odin Project, I plan on adding any completed projects to this list, and possibly updating some of these into a better version in the future. I plan on leaving the current versions as well, as I like seeing where I came from. Projects are displayed from newest to oldest.</div>
      <div class="projects">
        <div class="project">
          <div class="name">Calculator</div>
          <div class="description">A web calculator that can do simple operations</div>
          <div class="what-i-learned">This project combined many areas of the course so far, involving JavaScript logic, updating DOM elements, and the visual elements of the webpage. I mostly focused on making it hard to break. I tried to make sure it displayed both digits after a decimal point and numbers in exponential form correctly.</div>

          <div class="what-i-learned">I created JavaScript functions to run a game, and learned how to get user input through prompt. In a later project, I linked the game functionality with buttons on the webpage that would call the game functions when clicked.</div>

          <div class="what-i-learned">This project taught me the flexbox method to arrange elements on a page. I learned how the axes work and some of the aspects to make space be distributed how I wanted it. It was immediately interesting, as what I had done for the recipe project would have been much easier with flexbox.</div>
